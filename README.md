# IPSW-Gen

A work-in-progress custom firmware generator / firmware restorer for various devices.
  *Also the first tool/program I've made :)*

 **REQUIRES A BOOTROM EXPLOIT!!**
   *Or kloader if you know what you're doing*
  
  *First release will support the iPhone 3GS* **only**. (Also most likely limited to downgrading to 6.1.3)
  *More support will come eventually!*
  
  The pretty cool part is that, in theory, this tool *should* work for *any device* as long as you have firmware keys!
