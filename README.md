# IPSW-Gen

A work-in-progress custom firmware generator / firmware restorer for various devices.

 **REQUIRES A BOOTROM EXPLOIT!!**
 
   *Don't even think about asking me for support on the iPhone 4s and up...*
   *It won't happen unless someone wants to burn a BootROM exploit*

  *First release will support the iPhone 3GS* **only**. (Also most likely limited to downgrading to 6.1.3)
  *More support will come eventually!*
  
  **THIS IS A BETA TOOL! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR DEVICE AS A RESULT OF USING THIS TOOL!**
