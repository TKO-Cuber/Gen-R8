# Eth3r

A work-in-progress custom firmware generator.
  *Also the first tool/program I've made :)*

 **REQUIRES A BOOTROM EXPLOIT!**
   *Or kloader if you know what you're doing*
  
  *Current release supports the iPhone 3GS on 6.1.3* **only**!
  *More support will come eventually!*
  
  The pretty cool part is that, in theory, this tool *should* work for *any device* as long as you have firmware keys and patches (iBSS, iBEC, ASR).
    *Currently the patches I am using aren't working quite right... so when I figure that out then we should be good for other versions/devices*
